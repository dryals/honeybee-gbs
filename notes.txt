All hands meeting 5/8/24

tassel wont work since paired-end

stacks -> gatk
- more snps than tassel

rest of the bees
- depth vs coverage? I think we want more depth 
- 

gatk
- known sites list (we have)
- imputation on all known hb sequences
- compare against ipyrad

only sequence 8 bees per colony for CBH data

A-lin chromosome segments
- disequilibrium across large parts of chromosome
- adjacent snps make a chromosomal segment 
- wallberg paper easy to distinguish A-lin segments
- or ANCESTRY_HMM
    - distr of haplotypes: describe "american" honeybees at level of haplotype 
    - 

- snps that differentiate carnica from liguistica?
    - lots of carnica in the US instead of liguistica
    - how best to find carnica and ligustica 
    - hap
    
- Min will share more on library prep protocol

- metadata issue: make sure GBS connects directly to Gencove data
    - organize the other metadata
    
- update priority sheet with everything sent to UGA
    - CBH samples priority
    
- Seven needs dissertation material: GWAS

- Environmnetal component: lat and lon
    - metadata needs a lot of cleanup! 
    - have Amos turn all addresses to gps and standardize gps format?
